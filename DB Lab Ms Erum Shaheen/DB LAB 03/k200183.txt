Task 14 - Write a SQL statement to change the salary of employee to 2000 who’s ID is 105, if the existing salary is less than 1000.

Task 15 - Write a SQL statement to add a primary key for a combination of columns employee_id and job_id in employees table, give the reason why this command is showing error.

ALTER TABLE MY_EMPLOYEES ADD CONSTRAINT "JOBSid+EMPid as PK" PRIMARY KEY (EMPLOYEE_ID, JOB_ID);

Reason: One table can have ONLY ONE primary key at a given moment. The table "MY_EMPLOYEES" already as EMPLOYEE_ID set as the primary key, thus we can't make another primary key in the same table. To make a new primary key, we'll have to drop the current primary key.

Task 16 - Write a SQL statement to add an index named indx_job_id on job_id column in the table job_history.

CREATE INDEX INDX_JOB_ID ON JOBS_HISTORY01(JOB_ID);

Task 17 - Write a SQL statement to remove all the data in employee.

alter table jobs_history01 DROP COLUMN EMPLOYEE_ID;
TRUNCATE TABLE MY_EMPLOYEES;
